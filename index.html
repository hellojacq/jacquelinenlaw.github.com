        <h3>Project #1 Finding my Roots</h3>
        <p>After I finished my degree, I made a pilgrimage to China to learn more about my ancestral roots. I spent a year working as an English Instructor and immersed myself in learning as much as I could about the Chinese language and culture.</p>
          
        <h3>Project #2 Code Warrior </h3>
        <p>After working in a start-up environment, I had a desire to familiarize myself with basic fundamentals of programming. I've spent free time taking various programming workshops, courses and online tutorials. </p>
