        <p>Here are some of my accomplishments and works-in-progress over the past few years.</p>
        
        <h3>Project #1 Finding my Roots</h3>
        <p>After I finished my degree, I made a pilgrimage to China to learn more about my ancestral roots. I spent a year working as an English Instructor and immersed myself in learning as much as I could about the Chinese language and culture.</p>
          
        <h3>Project #2 Hittin' the Books </h3>
        <p>After working in a start-up environment, I had a desire to familiarize myself with basic fundamentals of programming. In my free time, I enjoy taking female-oriented programming workshops, courses and online tutorials. </p>

        <p>What else do you do in your spare time?</p>
        
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>When I'm not working, I spend most of my free time attending concerts/festivals to see artists I'm passionate about. Here are some of the highlights from the past 2 years:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Attended Coachella in 2011 and 2012. I saw Hologram Tupac IRL!</li>
          <li>Developed passion for Hip Hop music.</li>
          <li>I attend an average of 2 concerts/month.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Travel</h3>
        <p>If money/time weren't an object, I'd be a permanent nomad. Here are some places I visited within the past 2 years:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Costa Rica. <em>I went ziplining over a waterfall!</em></li>
          <li>Miami, FL. <em>I went to the Everglades and hung out with some gators. </em></li>
          <li>Yucatan Peninsula. <em> I went backpacking for 2 weeks and saw mayan ruins, swam with turtles and dove in cenotes.</em></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="fun-facts">Fun Facts</h2>

          <li>I am one of 5 daughters -- all of our names begin with 'J'!</li>
          <li>I've attended 3 Olympics and I'm heading to my 4th this summer.</li>
